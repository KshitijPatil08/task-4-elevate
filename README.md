# Task 4 â€“ Firewall Setup on Kali using UFW

##  Tool Used
- UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) on Kali Linux

##  What I Did
1. Enabled UFW firewall
2. Blocked Telnet traffic on port 23
3. Allowed SSH traffic on port 22
4. Deleted the Telnet block rule after testing

##  Why Port 23?
- Telnet (port 23) is insecure and often disabled.
- Blocking it is good practice to prevent unauthorized remote access.

##  Summary
UFW provides a simple way to manage Linux firewall rules to control network traffic and enhance system security.
